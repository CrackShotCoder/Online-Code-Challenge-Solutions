# Online-Code-Challege-Solutions
EDIT 5/23/2021: I'm 'retiring' this repository for a couple of reasons. For starters, I've come to the conclusion that random solutions to various algorithmic and syntax-based problems online aren't really what this should be for. If I want to see how I solved any of those problems, I can just go to my profile page on those sites (HackerRank, FreeCodeCamp, etc.)

Secondly, it's a little bit of a mess. I didn't know any naming conventions, accidentally deleted things multiple times then attempted to reupload in bulk, etc. 

I'm leaving it here though, as a reminder to myself how little I knew when I started and the progress I've made since then.
